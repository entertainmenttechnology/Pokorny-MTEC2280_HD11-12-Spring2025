## Short Sketch #1 - Digital Output
Create an Arduino sketch for the ESP32-S3 Dev Board implementing digitalWrite(). Program the microcontroller to display distinct On/Off patterns for the LEDs over time.
Must Include:
- a circuit with at least 4 LEDs including current limiting resistors
- declaration and use of at least 3 variables
- use of at least two conditional [if / else] statements
- use of delay() function
- use of logical comparator in at least one condition statement
- must display at least 4 unique LED patterns

Send me the the link to your GitHub repo (URL, not .git) via Discord if you have not already done so. This is where I will check for your completed work from now on.

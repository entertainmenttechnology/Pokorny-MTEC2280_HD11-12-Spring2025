## SESSION 13

## FINAL WIP #3: DUE 5/14
Your Final Work-In-Progress #2 is due on 5/14.      

Your WIP should reflect at least 12 to 20 hours of work. Since these are unique projects, the form of this work-in-progress will vary. It can be in Software, Hardware, or some combination thereof, but you must share your work at the start of class. For example, if you only work on coding this week, then your WIP will be be code uploaded to gitHub under "Final_WIP-3". If you spent the week building an enclosure, wiring electronics, or designing and printing a 3D model, then share related assets and images on your gitHub repo. At this point, you project should be in some form that can be play-tested in class.

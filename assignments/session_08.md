## SHORT SKETCH #4: DUE 4/2
Use (at least) 4 hardware sensors to control a Processing sketch. You may use any combination of buttons, potentiometers, photocell, or touch points as your sensor. The Processing sketch must include:
- use of sensor data (transmitted via UART) to control multiple elements of your Processing sketch.
- use of map() function
- use of data type casting
- use of declared variables
- use of background()
- use of fill()
- at least three graphics primitives
- display window width: max of 1080, min of 400
- display window height: max of 720, min of 400

Feel free to use images, sound library, etc. The content is completely up to you, but it needs to be controlled by Serial UART from Microcontroller.

### Familiarize yourself with:

* [Processing: Reference](https://processing.org/reference)

* [Processing: Serial Library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/index.html)

* [Processing: readBytesUntil()](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/Serial_readBytesUntil_.html)

* [Arduino: math functions such as constrain, abs, max, min](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/#functions)

Upload your completed code (both arduino & processing) to your repo before the beginnning of next class session. 
Have your project (both hardware and software aspects) ready to present at the next class critique.

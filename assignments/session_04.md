## Short Sketch #2 - Digital Input
Create an Arduino sketch for the ESP32-S3 Dev Board implementing digitalRead(). Using last week's short study as a jumping off point, program the microcontroller to display one of 4 unique patterns LED patterns based on button press. The button should cause program to switch between different LED patterns.

Must Include:
- a circuit with at least 4 LEDs including current limiting resistors
- declaration and use of at least 3 variables
- use of at least two conditional [if / else] statements
- use of logical comparator in at least one conditional statement
- a pushbutton implemented as counter
- Counter rollover: program should go back to 1st pattern if past last pattern.
- must display at least 4 unique LED patterns

Send me the the link to your GitHub repo (URL, not .git) via Discord if you have not already done so. This is where I will check for your completed work from now on!

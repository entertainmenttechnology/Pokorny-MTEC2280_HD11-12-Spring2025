## MIDTERM VERSION 2 DUE: 3/26

OPTIONAL, BUT HIGHLY ENCOURAGED:        
Based on feedback received during playtesting, do a 2nd iteration of your Midterm. Make sure you have included all the required elements from the assignment. Focus on debugging and user interface improvements rather than introducing new systems or elements.

See [MIDTERM](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC2280_HD11-12-Spring2025/blob/main/assignments/MIDTERM.md) for initial assignment details.

## SHORT SKETCH #3: DUE 3/26
Use a hardware analog sensor to control a software Processing sketch. You may use either a photocell/LDR or Potentiometer as your sensor. The Processing sketch must include:
- use of analog sensor data to control multiple elements of your Processing sketch. For example:
    - fill color, background color, shape size, shape location, etc.
- use of map() function
- use of declared variables
- use of background()
- use of fill()
- at least three graphics primitives
- display window width: max of 1080, min of 400
- display window height: max of 720, min of 400

Feel free to use images, sound library, etc. The content is completely up to you, but it needs to be controlled by Serial UART from Microcontroller.             

You may also use touchRead() as your analog sensor, though keep in mind that the range is considerably larger than 8-bit!

### Familiarize yourself with:

Upload your completed code (both arduino & processing) to your repo before the beginnning of next class session. 
Have your project (both hardware and software aspects) ready to present at the next class critique.

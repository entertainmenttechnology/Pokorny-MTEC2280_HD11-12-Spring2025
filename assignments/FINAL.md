### **FINAL PROJECTS**      
  
The time has arrived! Our final weeks of the semester will focus on final projects, driven by you. These Physical Computing projects will move through the following key (sometimes overlapping) phases: initial proposal, research and development, system prototype, fabrication, final development, testing and tweaking. These projects include an independent research component, based on your interests. As you propose and develop your project, it is critical to scope your project appropriately for the given timeline, your current skillset, and available tools and materials. 

    
## Project Parameters  
**Projects must:**   
* **Use sensors or actuators communicating between Arduino and Processing**: EITHER at least 2 sensors sending data from Arduino to Processing OR Processing sending data to at least 2 actuators OR two-way communication between Arduino and Processing with a combo of sensors and actuators. (If you have a project idea that does not meet the requirement above, discuss with me, as we can potentially modify this if another part of the project is more substantial.)  
NOTE: You may use another software application besides Processing that sends/receives data via UART (for example, Unity, P5.js, Max/MSP, etc.)  

* **Incorporate a physical interface or display of your own creation.** Your sensors and/or actuators must be embedded within a physical material, not sitting on a breadboard.
* **Function** (work as intended).
* **Be reactive or interactive**.  
* **Move significantly beyond our class demos and assignments**.
* **Exhibit creative risk**: be bold with your concept!
* Demonstrate thoughtfulness in the relationship between technique, aesthetics, participant experience, and concept. (As in: deliberate choices, with technical choices supporting the overall concept.)   
  
**Technical Research Challenge:**  
These projects must add a new technical challenge into the mix, something we have not covered in class. This may include a new sensor we have not yet worked with, a coding technique from a chapter in Learning Processing that we have not covered, or working with a new Arduino or Processing library. For ideas, scan through our book, demos, and supplies linked from the Resources section of our Wiki. Remember to keep the scope appropriate for the timeframe, something that will add to your project's creative concept and cohesive user experience, rather than overwhelming technical complexity.  
  
Want to explore a new sensor outside of your kit? Consider a [tilt sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/tilt-sensor), [pressure sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr), [PIR motion sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor), [flex sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1070), [magnetic contact switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/375?gclid=Cj0KCQiA7qP9BRCLARIsABDaZzgvMaoF26YHEVBHWjpBJE-WKsXWq8DGv8agno0gROb2FEOSbwfLcUoaAiHoEALw_wcB), or [ultrasonic sonar distance sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/ultrasonic-sonar-distance-sensors). Keep in mind that more complex sensors may need soldering, so please check in before ordering. It is also possible to make your own switches out of cheap materials like foil and cardboard. Check out [this floor switch example](https://www.instructables.com/Use-a-DIY-Pressure-Plate-Switch-to-Automate-Your-H/) which can be modified into various sizes and use cases.     

       
**What should I make?!?:**    
This project should be driven by your interests! It can be practical, design-driven, art-driven, absurd... it's up to you to drive it. Some ideas might include: a custom, sensor-based controller for interactive visuals or a simple game in Processing; an object-based controller for sound or video (output via Processing); or a standalone interactive object or sculpture. Consider found objects and cheap materials around you, including cardboard, fabric, plastic food containers, etc. Consider using your home environment (embedding sensors to make an interactive door, chair, mirror, kitchen table, etc.) You may build off of your midterm or a prior short study for this project.   

## To Include in Your Proposal (**Due Wednesday 4/23**):   
_ALL of the items below must be complete for the proposal to receive a green light:_ 
* A brief description of the concept and inspiration for the project.  
* What does it look like? Include a preliminary sketch of the project (hand-drawn or digital).
* What materials will you need to make it? (Include hardware, software, and physical materials.)  
* What skills and techniques do you already know in order to complete the project?
* What skills and techniques do you need to research and learn? (Include your independent technical research challenge here.)       
* Include at least 3 links to precedent research (other projects with technical, conceptual, or aesthetic overlap), with brief descriptions explaining how these precedents relate to and differ from your own project.       
* Create a calendar of tasks: Outline the specific steps for completing the project, with a proposed week by week timeline. Include any research, tutorials to complete, project iterations, and testing.              
   
_**Send proposals before class on 4/23 via Discord, as a PDF labeled as YourName_FinalProjectProposal.PDF.**_      
  
## Final Deliverables (**Due Wednesday 5/21**): 
* In a PDF uploaded to your gitHub repo:   
  * a final brief description of your project (What is the project concept? How do you use it? How is it working technically?)    
  * at least 3 photos documenting the completed project 
* Final code submitted to GitHub as "FinalProject_title" 
* A short video sent via Discord documenting the project in action. (This does not need to be a fancy or high production video, but it should be of a quality that you can use within 
 a portfolio.)    
* Project set up for live exhibition and playtesting at the beginning of our class on 5/21.  

## Code Notes:  
* In-progress code should be consistently pushed to your GitHub repo.
* Final sketches must include your name, title of project, and any user instructions included as a /* comment at the top of the sketch. */ 
* Any code borrowed or modified from another source, greater than 4 lines in length, must be attributed as // comments within your sketch. Unattributed code is considered plagiarism. Be sure to attribute! Include URL if from a website, page number if from a book, or person's name if receiving help from somebody.         
* If you are using media assets in your project (images, videos, music), be sure to attribute the source of the media as comments within your code, whether the author is yourself or someone else.  
* While you are encouraged to review online tutorials and demos, particularly for getting practice with a new technical concept, you cannot use someone else's demo or tutorial as the base of your own project. This project must be of your own concept and development. (If you have questions about this, please talk to me!)   
* At least 75% of the code from the project must be your own original code and ideas.

 ## Additional Fabrication Tips and Resources 
  
_AKA Getting Creative in Your "Home Lab"_
  
**General Fab Tips with Everyday Materials and Tools**  
* Check out this guide on [Cardboard Fundamentals](https://learn.adafruit.com/cardboard-fundamentals/overview).        
* Check out this [video on enclosure ideas](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2023/episode-11-writeup-creating-project-enclosures).    
* Consider found objects for enclosures.  
* Attach lightweight objects to [plastic horns](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4250) that snap onto servo motors. Use materials such as paper, cardboard, thin plastic, or fabric; and attach using thin gauge wire, thread, fishing wire, tape, or glue.       
  
  
**Tips for Wiring Without Soldering:**   
* Use [female/female jumpers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1950) (included in your kits) for extending wires without soldering. Wrap tape around connections for increased sturdiness.     
* [Alligator clips](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1008?gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0dz8lR2s8ktS_nlWKyUcZjFXcB8JZKju4dqQ7s20QHRiRKcVvfP1-rRoCZKMQAvD_BwE) are also useful for extending wires and connecting to components, particularly if needing to connect wires to [panel mount pushbuttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1505?gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0dxWLS20SCKN98w7zEEvGaQ1A3ecG9Ipk3L3E2sz8AOLUzpLZ3ucyjhoCMCsQAvD_BwE).   
* Most of you will be using 22 gauge solid core wire (included in your kits). For those wishing to connect stranded wire without soldering, one option is to use [wire nuts](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gardner-Bender-Wire-Connector-Kit-22-6-AWG-570-Pieces-CK-570/205874695?MERCH=REC-_-rv_search_plp_rr-_-NA-_-205874695-_-N). For connecting stranded wire to breadboards, [terminal blocks](https://www.adafruit.com/category/334) are handy.   
* Check out these tips for [mounting components within a matboard enclosure](https://vimeo.com/showcase/2801639/video/79552841). This also gets into wire wrapping with perf board, which does not need soldering but does need specialized tools.

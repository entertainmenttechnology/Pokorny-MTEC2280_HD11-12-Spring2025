## SESSION 11

## FINAL WIP #1: DUE 4/30
Your Final Work-In-Progress #1 is due on 4/30.      

Your WIP should reflect 3 to 5 hours of work. Since these are unique projects, the form of this work-in-progress will vary. It can be in Software, Hardware, or some combination thereof, but you must share your work. For example, if you only work on coding this week, then your WIP will be be code uploaded to gitHub under "Final_WIP-1". If you spent the week building an enclosure or designing and printing a 3D model, then share related assets and images. 

See the [FINAL project requirements](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC2280_HD11-12-Spring2025/blob/main/assignments/FINAL.md) for details.


## Fabrication Tips and Resources 

These are also posted at the bottom of Final Project...

  
**General Fab Tips with Everyday Materials and Tools**  
* Check out this guide on [Cardboard Fundamentals](https://learn.adafruit.com/cardboard-fundamentals/overview).        
* Check out this [video on enclosure ideas](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2023/episode-11-writeup-creating-project-enclosures).    
* Consider found objects for enclosures.  
* Attach lightweight objects to [plastic horns](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4250) that snap onto servo motors. Use materials such as paper, cardboard, thin plastic, or fabric; and attach using thin gauge wire, thread, fishing wire, tape, or glue.       
  
  
**Tips for Wiring Without Soldering:**   
* Use [female/female jumpers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1950) (included in your kits) for extending wires without soldering. Wrap tape around connections for increased sturdiness.     
* [Alligator clips](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1008?gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0dz8lR2s8ktS_nlWKyUcZjFXcB8JZKju4dqQ7s20QHRiRKcVvfP1-rRoCZKMQAvD_BwE) are also useful for extending wires and connecting to components, particularly if needing to connect wires to [panel mount pushbuttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1505?gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0dxWLS20SCKN98w7zEEvGaQ1A3ecG9Ipk3L3E2sz8AOLUzpLZ3ucyjhoCMCsQAvD_BwE).   
* Most of you will be using 22 gauge solid core wire (included in your kits). For those wishing to connect stranded wire without soldering, one option is to use [wire nuts](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gardner-Bender-Wire-Connector-Kit-22-6-AWG-570-Pieces-CK-570/205874695?MERCH=REC-_-rv_search_plp_rr-_-NA-_-205874695-_-N). For connecting stranded wire to breadboards, [terminal blocks](https://www.adafruit.com/category/334) are handy.   
* Check out these tips for [mounting components within a matboard enclosure](https://vimeo.com/showcase/2801639/video/79552841). This also gets into wire wrapping with perf board, which does not need soldering but does need specialized tools.

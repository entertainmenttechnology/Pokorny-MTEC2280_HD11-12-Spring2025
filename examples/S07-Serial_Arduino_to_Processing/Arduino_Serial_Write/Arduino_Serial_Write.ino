  "SERIAL COMMS INTRO - BASIC UART"
  - Sending Data from MicroController Hardware to Processing Software

  DEMO FOR SENDING SERIAL DATA FROM ARDUINO TO PROCESSING
  READS ANALOG SENSOR AND WRITES VALUE TO SERIAL PORT
  IMPLEMENTS REPEATING SOFTWARE TIMER TO STABILIZE SERIAL COMMS

  NOTE:
  - You must STOP Processing Sketch before uploading to MCU.
  - Otherwise, the UART port used for upload will be blocked by UART comms to Processing

### COURSE DESCRIPTION  
Students learn to sense and control the physical world through hardware and software, creating interactive interfaces beyond conventional computing. Students gain skills in basic electronics, circuit assembly, and microcontroller programming for sensor and actuator control. The course culminates in a self-directed physical computing project, moving through a design process from ideation to functional prototype.
     

### LEARNING OUTCOMES       
For the successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:    
* Write code to program a microcontroller. 
* Recognize and apply electronics principles when developing microcontroller-based systems.
* Use sensors and actuators to create interfaces between physical and digital environments.    
* Conduct and integrate independent technical research into project development.  
* Complete a self-driven physical computing project, from ideation through final prototype.  
   
  
###  COURSE STRUCTURE  
The course combines lectures, critiques, discussions, and studio/lab time. Typically, students work on technical exercises each week, along with short study projects applying these newly learned techniques. There will be two larger projects during the semester (a midterm and final project), mostly independently driven, with iterative project development. Course materials and assignments for the week’s session will be posted to GitHub on the same day of class. Assignments are due before the next class session begins. Sessions will be held in person, unless otherwise noted in the course schedule.

## PROJECTS AND ASSIGNMENTS      
* Weekly readings and technical exercises, for developing physical computing foundations andbuilding conceptual framework.  
* Weekly creative short study assignments, demonstrating proficiency in electronics prototyping and coding for microcontrollers. Students implement required technical parameters for each week’s topic.   
* Midterm Project – a largely self-directed work exploring the topics covered in the first half of the semester, while expanding upon one or more short study assignments. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.
* Final Project – a largely self-directed work, supported by independent research and iterative project development. Students present proposals for the instructor to green-light, which includes a calendar of tasks and deliverables. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.   
  
## REQUIRED MATERIALS               
* [Electronics Kit](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC2280_HD11-12-Spring2025/blob/main/electronics%20kit/eKit.md)
* A sketchbook, or paper to sketch with (does not need to be exclusive to this class).
* A Mac or PC computer with internet access for assignments outside of class (either your own, or from a lab on campus).
* Free software and accounts: Discord, Github, Arduino IDE, VS Code, Web Browser.       
    
## EXPECTATIONS    
By signing up for this class, you are making a **commitment to fully participate, support your classmates as best you can, and do your part in creating a positive class environment**. For our course to run smoothly, everyone must:       
* **Show up to class on time**, ready to contribute.          
* **Check Discord** regularly for group and private messages.     
* **Check our class GitHub repo** regularly for posted assignments.          
* **Back up work** regularly.                
* Spend **at least 3-5 additional hours a week** (outside of class) on class projects and exercises. Midterm and Final Projects may require additional time, depending on your ambition. Budget more time each week than may be needed.              
* **Reach out** to your peer group and your instructor via Discord with questions.   
* **Push creatively and technically.** Stay open and curious.     
  
### COMMUNICATION

* **If you have a question that may be relevant to the group**, post in the #general channel on Discord for all to see and comment on.      
* Use Discord for **easy communications with your classmates** as well—you can DM individuals or selected groups.  
* **To discuss a longer matter** with your instructor, set up an appointment for office hours.  
  
## PARTICIPATION POLICY (The Rules + Regulations for Keeping the Ship Sailing)     
* **We will begin promptly at the start of each class.**           
* As **our work is interdependent**, it is critical for everyone to be fully present, participating, and engaging in the course.   
* If absent from class, this will impact other students and lab activities. **If you will be late or absent, DM your instructor via Discord ASAP.**          
* **Absences may be excused in the following cases:** illness, religious observance with advanced notice, and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events and extenuating circumstances.         
* In the case of an absence, check GitHub and **contact a classmate to catch up** on what you missed. Contact the instructor if you have additional questions.  
* Each student is asked to play their part in supporting our class, by **contributing regularly to peer groups** via Discord, for feedback and technical support.               
* **Midterm and Final Project critiques are mandatory and cannot be made up.** Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding project.

If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
